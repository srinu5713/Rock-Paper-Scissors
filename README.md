# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in Python using tkinter for the GUI and PIL for image handling.

## Introduction

This project is a classic game of Rock Paper Scissors where the user plays against the computer. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) to display choices and scores dynamically.

## Features

- **GUI Implementation**: Built using tkinter for a user-friendly interface.
- **Image Handling**: Utilizes PIL (Python Imaging Library) to display images of rock, paper, and scissors.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's and computer's scores.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows resetting the game scores and messages.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository:**
